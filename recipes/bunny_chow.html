    <h2>Steps/Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim any excess fat off the chicken thighs and pat dry with kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>In a big bowl, mix together 45ml (3 Tbsp) of the olive oil, the tomato paste,<br> lemon juice and Robertsons
            Braai & Grill All-In-One. <br>Toss the chicken quarters through the marinade and allow to sit for 30
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill to medium. Place the chicken quarters, skin side down, on the grill and allow them to
            take on good colour.<br>
            Continue cooking and turning the chicken pieces until the skin is crispy and they are
            cooked right through.</li>
        <li>Heat another 15ml (1 Tbsp) of the olive oil in a pan, over a high heat. Add the tomatoes,<br>
            and cook, tossing occasionally, until they are slightly charred and blistered. Remove from the pan and allow
            to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Tip the roasted tomatoes into a bowl and add the remaining 15ml (1 Tbsp) olive oil together with the
            olives,<br>
            Robertsons Masterblends Zesty Lemon & Herb, fresh basil leaves, garlic and lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken pieces on a platter and scatter over the tomato olive mixture.</li>
